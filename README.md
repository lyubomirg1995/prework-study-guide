# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This study guide was created for my personal use, whenever I need a refresher on basic HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript concepts, given the  quantity of information one will be required to learn. Repeated referencing of this page, followed by application of the listed concepts in independent practice, will help commit the information in students' long-term memory. Information is presented in the order it was learned, with progressively higher complexity from top to bottom of the website. For example, this helped me build the habit of following the proper steps in the proper order to pull and push information from the local repository to a remote repository, in order to avoid merging conficts, divergent branches, and other errors associated with improper commital of code updates. This study guide is in its infancy and therefore not the final product; it will be updated regularly.

## Usage

Git and Github concepts are applied in the written order. Given my prior experience with CSS, notes aren't needed as of yet. The proper for loop, conditional statements, and array lines of code can be recreated with the written cues in the Javascript section. Finally, no HTML notes beyond simple definitions are needed.
